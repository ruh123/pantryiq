# PantryIQ

A verified recipe data platform with a data-grounded AI layer. The headline is **entity
resolution**: free-text recipe ingredients resolved to canonical USDA food entities with
measured precision/recall — so the AI layer can only speak from verified nutrition, cost, and
ingredient data, with a deterministic check on every numeric claim it makes.

- **Operating brief (locked decisions, phase gates):** [`docs/PantryIQ_Master_Prompt.md`](docs/PantryIQ_Master_Prompt.md)
- **Full design:** [`docs/PantryIQ_Design_Doc.md`](docs/PantryIQ_Design_Doc.md)

## Status

**Phase 1 complete** — Bronze landed and DuckDB-verified: `bronze.raw_recipes` (15,000
RecipeNLG rows, the subset-first sample) and `bronze.raw_usda_foods` (8,187 USDA Foundation +
SR Legacy foods). Phase 2 (Silver + entity resolution — the headline) in progress.

## Setup

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```
make setup   # create the venv (Python 3.11) and install dev deps
make test    # run tests
make lint    # ruff check
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in keys.

## Data

Datasets are gitignored (large). To reproduce Phase 1:

- **RecipeNLG** (~2.2M recipes, ~2.3 GB) — download `full_dataset.csv` from
  <https://recipenlg.cs.put.poznan.pl/> (accept the terms form), place it at
  `data/raw/recipenlg/full_dataset.csv`, then sanity-check:
  `uv run python scripts/inspect_recipenlg.py`.
- **USDA FoodData Central** — free API key from
  <https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup.html> → put in `.env` as `USDA_API_KEY`.

### Regenerating Bronze

```
uv run python -m pantryiq.ingestion.recipes   # -> bronze.raw_recipes    (15,000 rows)
uv run python -m pantryiq.ingestion.usda      # -> bronze.raw_usda_foods (8,187 rows)
```

Both are idempotent (each re-run overwrites its table; a 0-row result is refused rather than
silently wiping the table). The USDA counts are a **live** pull from 2026-07-22 — Foundation
grows over time, so a later pull may exceed 394 Foundation / 7,793 SR Legacy. The lakehouse
lives in `data/lakehouse/` (gitignored); delete that directory for a clean regeneration.
